1. Attemp-1 is an ensemble of InceptionV3 and Xception model. The test accuracy is in ~86%.

2. To add more approaches -> ensemble of EffNet and ResNet.

The issue with these notebooks are the time constraint for the competetion which is that the notebook should compile in 8hrs. This includes training and testinf time. A similar accuracy was reaches using ResNet-50 and training its head and then finetuning it but runtime was way over 8hrs.
